## Tasks

- [x] #73 - Use CSS face error (PR #79) - fixed Rules of Hooks violation ✅
- [ ] #74 - Pipeline Issue (PR #77) - waiting for PROJECT_TOKEN with `repo` + `project` scopes

## Halo CSS Fix (#75)
**Problem:** The halo around CSS/SVG face didn't fit properly like it does for avatar mode

**Root Cause:** Different positioning approach between modes:
- Avatar mode: Halo inside tilt wrapper with `-inset-4`
- CSS mode: Halo outside tilt wrapper with percentage-based positioning

**Solution:**
- Moved halo inside tilt wrapper (consistent with avatar mode)
- Changed to `-inset-4` positioning for uniform extension
- Added `w-full aspect-square` to tilt wrapper
- Matched container class with avatar mode

**PR:** https://github.com/giofcosta/openclaw-face/pull/78

## CSS Face Switching Error (#73)
**Problem:** Page goes blank with console error when switching between CSS face and Avatar modes

**Root Cause:** Rules of Hooks violation - `useMemo` hooks (`faceColor`, `glowIntensity`) were called AFTER the conditional early return for avatar mode. When switching modes, React expected the same hooks order but encountered hooks that were previously skipped.

**Solution:**
- Moved `faceColor` and `glowIntensity` useMemo hooks BEFORE the conditional return
- All hooks now always execute regardless of mode

**PR:** https://github.com/giofcosta/openclaw-face/pull/79

## Notes
- Giovanni asked to pause #73 (CSS face error) until tomorrow
- #76 (New 3D identity) is NOT assigned to me - skipping per workflow rules
- Tests: 82 passed, 10 skipped
