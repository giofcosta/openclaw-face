## Tasks

- [x] #70 - Theme Backgrounds (PR #72) ✅ MERGED
- [ ] #74 - Pipeline Issue (PR #77) - waiting for Giovanni to add PROJECT_TOKEN secret

## Pipeline Fix (#74)
**Root Cause:** `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot access user-owned Projects V2
- GraphQL query returns empty `projectItems.nodes` because token lacks permissions
- Workflow runs "successfully" but doesn't actually move cards

**Solution:** Use Personal Access Token (PAT) with `project` scope
- Changed `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` → `secrets.PROJECT_TOKEN`
- Added setup documentation to README

**Required Action:** Giovanni needs to create PAT with `project` scope and add as `PROJECT_TOKEN` secret

## Notes
- All 10 face features completed
- PRs #71 and #72 merged by Giovanni
- Issues #69 and #70 now in Done column
