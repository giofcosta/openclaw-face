## Model Status

- **Current model:** anthropic/claude-opus-4-6 (fallback)
- **GLM-5 attempt failed:** Added custom model definition to config but got "Unknown model: zai/glm-5"
- **Issue:** GLM-5 not in OpenClaw's model registry yet, custom definition didn't work
- **Config changes made:** Added `zai` provider with `glm-5` model in `models.providers` section
- **Need to investigate:** Correct way to add new models to zai provider
